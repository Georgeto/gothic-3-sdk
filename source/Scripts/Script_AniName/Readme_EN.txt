--- Script_AniName ---

0. Description
Usually to determine the animations (.xmot) to use for an animated mesh (.xact),
Gothic 3 takes the second word in the mesh file name as the animation prefix.
This Script overrides that mapping for certain species:
  - gESpecies_Skeleton: Skeleton_....xmot
  - gESpecies_Zombie: Zombie_....xmot

1. Installation
The 'scripts' folder has to be copied into the Gothic 3 install folder.
There is no need to start a new game.
